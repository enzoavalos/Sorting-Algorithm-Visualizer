# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
### Visualizing the way sorting algorithms work was never this easy!

## Topics involved:
- Algorithms implemented: Quicksort, Radixsort, MergeSort, Shellsort, Timsort and Heapsort.
- Classes and instances
- Basic GUI design

### Technologies used:
- Python 3.8.8
- pygame version 2.0.1  

## Steps to get started:  
If you want to see the final program in execution, there is a ***How it works video*** included in this repo. On the other hand, if you wish to execute the program yourself, keep reading...  
### Prerequisites:  
It will be needed for you to download the files present in the repo and save them all in the same directory. Additionaly, it is a requirement to have both [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the library [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) installed on your machine.  
After you have already downloaded and installed python you can use the following commands in the terminal to install pygame depending on your OS:
- **Windows:**
 ```
 pip install pygame
 ```
- **Mac:**
 ```
 pip3 install pygame
 ```
- **Linux:**  
 Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:
 ```
 sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
 ```
 Fedora/Red hat:
 ```
 sudo yum install python3-pygame
 ```
 
Finally, to run the program, either an IDE or interpreter will be needed, my recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
After installation you will also need to download the phyton extension. In order to do this just prees the keyboard shortcut:
```
Ctrl + Shift + P
```
This will open the Command Palette, where you must type and select the option **Extensions: Install Extensions**.
The last step is to search for python and select the first option, which will open a window where you can finally install the python extension.
Once this is done you are good to go, open the file **Main.py** in Visual Studio and run it with the shortcut:
```
Ctrl + F5
```

## Actions in the app:
### Once inside the app you will be able to:
- Visualize all of the algorithms previously mentioned along with the time they take to complete
- Change their execution speed, if you want a deeper understanding of how they work
- Disable the visualization, this way you will see the actual time it takes for a certain algorithm to sort the full array
